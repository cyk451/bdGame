TO be clear:
1. where to insert the ability hooks?
2. should abilities be an abstract? should we let developers make plugin abilities?
3. should i let running battle to be an exclusive screen?
4. should we let battle computation threaded??

todos
1. first, let the battle engine to run anyway.
2. second, struct the battle abilities idea.
3. extract formation editor from battle screen.
4. list all abillities bd has

better to have:
1. configurable formation size
2.
